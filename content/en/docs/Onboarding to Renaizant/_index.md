{{< load-photoswipe >}}

This is your first-login guide for onboarding organization to Renaizant. A guide for HR or Managers, who will be app administrators but haven't started working with it yet.

With this guide, you'll see how to add your organization, invite employees, and represent your infrastructure in Renaizant.

## Step 1: Add Your Company and Specify Primary Info

When you open the app for the first time, it suggests you to create a company and add company and personal info:

1. Choose a preferable login method: Slack, Google, or Microsoft and sign in.
2. If you've added another organization before or belong to some organization already, select the "Add new organization" button to proceed. For the first timers this step is skipped.
3. Select the "Start" button and provide the following info:
   - Organization name;
   - Start typing in the industry and pick the one that suits best from the suggested options;
   - Company size.
Once ready, select the "Create organization" button.
4. Now tell a bit about yourself. Select the "Start" button to proceed:
   - (optional) Pick the year and month you started to work at the organization.
   - (optional) Type in the school you went to, degree, the field of study, and start & end dates.
   - (optional) Pick the person you're reporting to (if it's not you, you'll select them once you import more users to the app), gender, race, and whether you have any disabilities or are a veteran.
Select the "Finish" button.

Now tell us what problem you want to solve using Renaizant and we'll show you which features will help you the most. For best results, select from 1 to 3 issues you want to solve and select the "Start tour" button. Continue through the tour until the end and select the "Get started" button to go to your organization.

## Step 2: Create Career Path

The Career Path is the place to track your organization's and employee's growth. [Learn more about the Career Path feature](https://renaizant.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012584959) and [how to configure it](https://renaizant.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012272360-Career-Path-Create-and-Edit-Admin-Mode-).

## Step 3: Create Organization Chart

The Organization chart shows the internal structure of your organization. At this stage, you need to [create chart and present your company's departments](https://renaizant.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013577179). Then, once you import users to Renaizant (step 4 of this guide), you can go back to the Organization chart and assign departments' leads and members. See the ["How to edit department after initial Organization chart set-up"](https://renaizant.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013577179) section in our guide to help with this.

## Step 4: Set Up Integrations & Import Users

### Integrations

Renaizant seamlessly integrates with popular services, such as Slack, G-Suite, GitHub, Jira, and Office 365 to offer intuitive experience and save time during the organizational routine.

Set up integration with Slack:

1. Go to the menu > Administration > Integrations.
2. Turn on the toggle button near the Slack icon.
3. Then, you'll see the Slack integration settings—type in the Slack workspace URL, sign in to your Slack account, allow Renaizant access to your Slack workspace, and the job is done!

Integration with Slack will further help you import users and send them various notifications.

Other integrations are similarly straightforward.

### Users

No need to add users manually—you can import them with GSuite, Slack, and Office 365, or via email so the accounts are synchronized with the apps you already use.

Here are the steps on how to import users by email:

1. Go to the menu > Administration > Users.
2. Select the "Invite by email" button.
3. Send invitations one by one or invite multiple users at once:
   - **One by one:** Type in the employee's name and email. Select the "+ Add another" button to add more employees.
   - **Multiple:** Select the "Add multiple users at once" button and use one of two options — add emails manually and separate them with comma or import contacts via .xlsx file.
4. Select the "Invite" button and new employees will appear in the list of users.
5. As you've already added jobs to the Career Path, you can assign the jobs to employees. Pick the job title in the drop-down menu near the employee's name and select the "Submit" button.

Another way of assigning titles, is to assign one job title to several or all employees at once:

- Select the checkboxes next to the users or pick them all with the checkbox at the top.
- Select the "Change job title" at the top of the table.

With the multi-tool menu, you can also assign team or department, and verify, deactivate, or delete users.

- Pick the job family and job title in the sidebar menu on the right.
- Save the changes.

If you don't assign jobs to employees by yourself, they can do this when they first log in to the company. Please make sure to double-check the Users table from time to time and validate users' changes with the "Verify" button.
