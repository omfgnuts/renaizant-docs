One of Renaizant's stronger sides is being able to offer reasonable and just-in-time promotion and professional growth of employees. In this article we will explain general capabilities of the Career Path feature and core ideas behind it.

Renaizant has brought a new perspective into the Salary Bands and Job Grades system by combining it with other features, all in one place. With the Career Path in the Renaizant, you can operate with the following data:

- **Statistics** - number of employees, people provided their desired position, and open positions;
- **My Path** - job history in the company and the desired position of an employee who is opening Renaizant from their account;
- **All Paths** - Bands and Grades, Career Tracks, Job Families, and Jobs.

Each Job includes info about:

- Job Title, preferably with the seniority-level notation;
- Employees with this job title;
- Employees with this job title as their next position;
- Employees with this job as their desired position;
- Required experience;
- Open seats.

## What Lies Behind the Career Path

<!-- TODO: This section and the heading especially requires complete rewrite/restructure/more details, as it currently does not make any sense to me, and therefore to the reader.-->

We have Band/Grade Structure placed horizontally, Career Tracks and Job Families placed vertically, and Jobs within them.

These components are covered and shared by each company more or less, so you can just present them in Renaizant, or use this moment to make some refinement of your existing system with a fresh eye or try to create a new one with us. If you haven't dealt with this before, our in-app tips and templates will come in handy!

Still, polishing and adding these components requires some help so we will provide some preparatory info before you go into filling in the Career Path scheme for your organization.

## Bands and Grades

Renaizant

The framework for our Career Path is a widely used system of bands and grades. We won't surprise you with the banding but will show you how we interpreted it so you could optimize the processes of your company.

Grades & Bands system allows to:

- Structure and rank jobs;
- Build linear paths for vertical career growth;
- Put together inconsistent jobs and show possibilities of horizontal career growth;
- Show the current position of each employee and pave the way to the desired ones, not limiting the employee to vertical or horizontal growth.

In Renaizant, you will define how many bands and grades to add depending on the scale of ranks suitable for your organization. Please remember that Renaizant doesn't allow processing the payment-related issues for now but to provide a base to track the bands and grades for it.

Here's the example of ranking the jobs with banding:

You can notice that not all cells are filled in. That is totally fine—not all the career tracks begin from the entry level; it's hard to imagine a junior executive director, right? Also, each career track has its own length—a sequence of progressive jobs within one profession. Furthermore, an employee can follow a vertical, horizontal, or even multi-skilling path.

## Career Tracks and Job Families

Managers tended to be associated with success in an individual's career, but nowadays, success is not only about the managerial rank. The modern dual-career approach enables a recognition of technical and other non-managerial contributors who don't have managerial ambitions and provides employees with greater opportunities for vertical growth without becoming a manager. This approach suggests outlining two career tracks—managerial and individual contributor. Of course, this is just a recommendation—you can add more career tracks in Renaizant.

Surely you have lots of jobs in each career track that can be divided into big groups across different subject areas such as finances, engineers, design. The groups containing related occupations are called job families.

Define career tracks, job families...And ta-dah, the hierarchy is ready!

Jobs Themselves! :)
We have a hierarchy of jobs and grades & bands to range them. How can we correctly put all the different jobs together within one system? Before we start adding jobs to the Career Path, we should jot down some points to determine the order of jobs.

You might be thinking that seniority level is the answer, it's one way to do it, but it's not the only answer. In fact, you'll want to decide what specific aspects you want to focus on, whether it's proficiency, acquiring new skills, performance, employment terms, or a combination of them. By making and documenting these decisions, you show your employees what they need to do to achieve and earn more. 

For this you need to evaluate—rank and order—the jobs for all jobs in the company. There are several job evaluation methods; the most common practice is a point method.

When using the point method, the content of jobs can be described in terms of key factors—qualities of a job. Each factor is assigned points according to the extent to which that particular factor is presented in the job. The more points you assign to a job, the more worth the job has to the organization, thus, compensated more. There may be a group of factors for all jobs, various jobs separately, or a combination of companywide and position-specific factors.

With the Hay point method system, a job is evaluated by looking at four factors:

The knowledge required to do the job;
The way of thinking needed to solve the problems which the job commonly faces;
The responsibilities (accountabilities) assigned;
The working conditions.


The example of evaluation using the Hay system.

For sure, you have various seniority levels for each job, so you'll need to compare different levels of each job, like trainee-junior-middle-senior level or using some other customized range.

Having ranged the jobs, we just need to put them in the right place in the matrix.
What do we have as a result?
Automatization tools can't replace humans in making decisions but can help to gather the required information. Renaizant assists everyone in the company: employees, managers, HR, and even CEOs:

Employees can: 
Visualize the job hierarchy and their current position in it;
Involve an employee in their structured and regular development: offer education, help them to plan and visualize their career opportunities and direction that follow the needs and experience of the organization;
Find people who can help them to gain the necessary experience.

Managers can: 
Observe the level of their teams;
Identify employees who desired promotion and provide help, coaching, and mentorship for them;
Find the most experienced employees to help with internal education;
Find the most suitable internal candidates to take open vacancies.

HR can:
Assess the speed of promotion in the organization;
Analyze staffing levels;
Group employees by desired positions and levels to organize bulk education;
Make the promotion process transparent and accessible for all employees;
Prevent demotivation and decreases in employee productivity because of getting stuck in the same position and not understanding career opportunities within the organization.

CEO can: 
Have eyes on general staffing situation of the company and the number of open seats;
Keep track of the number of employees in the company in total and per job family and position separately.
