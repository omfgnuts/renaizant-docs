In this guide, we explain general concepts that lie behind the idea of 360º Feedback and explain the basic workflow.

360º Feedback is a tool for receiving multi-source feedback that lets employees compare own self-esteem with an opinion of other people, their impressions of cooperation. This is a real opportunity for managers to help employees identify not just development zones but also risk zones, and to confirm hypotheses about own strengths.

Regular assessment of 360º Feedbacks helps to form a «customer orientation» in the company's internal market and ability to perceive colleagues and subordinates as internal customers.

Tendencies to ditch the traditional manager-employee performance review in favor of 360ºs are especially noticeable in recent years, but here, at Renaizant, both approaches are accompanying each other. Performance reviews are good for discussing wider and more complex topics, coming up with new objectives and career plans. General advice would be to combine both performance reviews and 360ºs and conduct them several times a year each.

## How does Renaizant Help

Renaizant's motto is «simplify what can be simplified». All you need to do to perform a successful 360º is to set a milestone, write down the questionnaire, and Renaizant will do the rest. Renaizant nudges employees when it's time to pick reviewers, it lets everyone know how, and specifically when to give feedback and much, much more. The general UI is as straightforward as any social network, such as Twitter or Facebook!

As for **Admins** and **Managers**, there is an informative overview dashboard, where they see the progress across the entire company and ability to poke those who are running late.

## Basic Workflow

Renaizant is complex at the core, but straightforward and highly flexible for users to operate. But remember, there are lots of advanced features that let you bend and twist Renaizant to suit your purposes and your corporate workflow.

Here's the workflow that outlines five basic steps you will follow during 360º configuration:

1. An administrator creates as many 360º Feedback cycles as needed (they can run in parallel, for different audiences and purposes). The cycle contains a list of employees who get reviewed, reviewers, a timeline, and a questionnaire.
2. Once managers are done creating an assessment, reviewees, and reviewers get notified.
3. Reviewees provide a self-assessment, and reviewers write their feedback until a deadline that's selected by admin in Step 1. Those who are running late are reminded to complete an activity before the cycle ends.
4. Then, once the cycle ends, all the people involved receive notifications.

## Further Reading

We like our documentation clean, friendly, and understandable and offer instructions for all user roles:

- **End-user:** We guide a user through the 360º Feedback process from an employee perspective. It also will be useful for HRs, as it's important to know what regular employees see. We've sprinkled docs with screenshots for better convenience.
- **Manager:** If you work as a supervisor/manager, we will guide you through the review process, you will learn how to approve direct reports reviewer selection and all the little tricks.
- **Admin:** Read how an administrator can set up reviews for everyone, monitor progress, and basically how to get even started! All the smallest options are described in an understandable and friendly manner ;)
