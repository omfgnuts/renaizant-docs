Renaizant is a product focused on owners and managers of organizations that want to be able to get an instant overview of personnel activities related to their involvement, performance, and priorities.

We're building and improving Renaizant as an understandable and easily approachable tool that is user-friendly and intuitive, but every user is different, and knowledge background also varies. We know from our experience that learning and mastering new tools can still be frustrating and challenging.

The knowledge base serves as a starting point for newcomers, and also contains various useful information whether you are looking for specific details, instructions, or solely in need of an overall table of contents of Renaizant's features.
